# About
a 3-rod Towers of Hanoi animated solution generator that accepts a number of disks between 5 and 10, created as a part of [p1xt's "Web development with computer science foundations" guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md).
this was my first time working with the [canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and i got pretty comfortable with it, i also know a fair bit more about [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) now.
